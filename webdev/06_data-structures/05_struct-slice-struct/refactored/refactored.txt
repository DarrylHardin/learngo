//A different way of writing


data := items{
		Wisdom:    sages,
		Transport: cars,
	}

type items struct {
 	Wisdom    []sage
	Transport []car
}

//refactored to:

data := struct {
		Wisdom    []sage
		Transport []car
	}{
		sages,
		cars,
	}

//removing the need for:

type items struct {
 	Wisdom    []sage
	Transport []car
}
